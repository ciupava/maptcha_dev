    "The aim is to generate images for maptcha in a programmatic (automated?) way.\n",
    "We have the RGB (\"true\" image from satellite/UAV, `.tif`) and the labels/prediction results (vectorial, so it can be shown \"on top\" of the RGB, `.geojson`). We want to have a single image out of these 2, a `jpg`, where they are overlaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "We comprise 2 stages:\n",
    "1. overlay the two datasets, this would generate a jpg image\n",
    "2. generate tiles out of the jpg image (possibly on where data exists)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaining the point 2: the original images come in tiles, spread across a city/region. See below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a screenshot of the result we would like to obtain, where actually we would like to have the single tiles saved one by one. This in Qgis is easy to visualise, but would be tedious to generate the final tiles as an overlaid image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**...THIRD STAGE?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We do still need to classify these in false/true and positive/negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "I see how the labels could help in this, but it seems still less tedious and time-consuming to generate the classification by hand?\n",
    "\n",
    "... more to think on this.\n",
